# 3D_Mosfet_Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a simulation setup for a 3D MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor). The project aims to model and analyze the electrical behavior of a MOSFET using computational methods. The simulation input file and structure images provide insight into the setup and results of the simulation.

## Repository Contents
- `3d_mosfet_try.in.txt` - Input file for the simulation.
- `Structure_1.jpg`, `Structure_2.jpg`, `Structure_3.jpg` - Images showing the MOSFET structure.

## Prerequisites
To run the simulation, you may need:
- A compatible semiconductor device simulation tool (e.g., Sentaurus, Silvaco TCAD, or COMSOL Multiphysics)
- Python or MATLAB (if post-processing scripts are included in the future)

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diveshrao1708/3D_Mosfet_Simulation.git
   cd 3D_Mosfet_Simulation
   ```
2. Load the `3d_mosfet_try.in.txt` file into your simulation tool.
3. Run the simulation and analyze the output.
4. Use the structure images for reference to understand the modeled device.

## Future Enhancements
- Addition of post-processing scripts for result visualization.
- Documentation of simulation parameters and expected results.
- Benchmarking against experimental or theoretical models.
